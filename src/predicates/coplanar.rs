//! Coplanar triangle and projected 3D helper predicates.
//!
//! Coplanar triangle overlap is a 2D arrangement problem embedded in 3D. This
//! module projects triangles only onto a coordinate plane whose projected
//! orientation is certified nonzero by exact predicates; no primitive-float
//! normal magnitude or epsilon selects the projection. The overlap test is then
//! decomposed into exact 2D segment intersections and point-in-triangle
//! classifications. Representation choices may preserve structure, but
//! combinatorial claims require certified predicates.
