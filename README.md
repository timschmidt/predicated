`hyperlimit` provides exact geometry predicates over `hyperreal::Real` values. Predicate
calls return both the classified result and provenance for how the result was decided.

The crate is not a polygon, mesh, BSP, CSG, or intersection engine. It owns reusable
predicate semantics and strict escalation; object topology belongs in the higher crate
that owns the geometry.

## Typical Predicate Problems

Geometry algorithms usually fail at branch points: a determinant near zero, a point
exactly on a segment, a cocircular/cospherical test, or a broad-phase shortcut that
disagrees with topology. Pure `f64` code often patches those cases with tolerances, but
one wrong sign can change triangulation, booleans, mesh topology, clearance reports, or
solver active sets.

`hyperlimit` makes the escalation ladder part of the API. It uses structural facts,
exact reducers, certified interval/ball filters, and bounded `Real` refinement. If the
strict escalation cannot certify a result, it returns `Unknown` with provenance rather
than inventing a float decision.

## Main Types

- `Point2`, `Point3`, point facts, shared-scale point views, `HomogeneousPoint3`, and
  `HomogeneousLine3` are predicate-facing re-exports of lattice-owned object carriers.
- `Plane3`, `Plane3Facts`, `PreparedPlane3`, and homogeneous plane-incidence helpers
  keep 3D sidedness and projective incidence under strict predicates.
- `PredicateOutcome<T>`, `PredicateReport<T>`, `PredicateCertificate`, `Certainty`,
  `Escalation`, `PredicatePrecisionStage`, and `PredicateApiSemantics` describe what was
  decided and how.
- Predicate escalation uses the single strict exact/refined path; callers do not
  select alternate policies.
- `Sign`, `LineSide`, `PlaneSide`, `TriangleLocation`, `SegmentIntersection`,
  `TriangleTriangleIntersection`, `RingPointLocation`, interval, and AABB
  classifications are the common result enums.
- `orient_d`, `insphere_d`, and `affine_independent_d` provide the first exact
  D-dimensional determinant predicate boundary for triangulation and mesh crates.
- Immediate segment, triangle, AABB, line, circle/sphere, and halfspace functions
  accept explicit retained facts or evidence where reuse changes the cost.
- `SupportDop3` and `SupportSlab3` retain exact support-axis bounds and source
  witnesses for reusable k-DOP/bounding-volume slab predicates; report-bearing
  AABB projection and oriented-plane classifiers preserve per-slab exact
  interval and halfspace feasibility evidence.
- `HalfspaceFeasibilityReport` records exact 3D halfspace feasibility witnesses,
  active plane sets, and Farkas-style infeasibility certificates for replayable
  convex-kernel prechecks.
- Session types such as `ExactGeometrySession`, `ConstructionCertificate`,
  `VersionedFacts`, and `VersionedPrepared` track cache freshness and construction
  provenance.

## Precision Model

Predicate coordinates are `Real` values. The resolver tries exact structural facts,
determinant term facts, exact reducers, certified interval/ball filters, and bounded
`Real` refinement. Approximate edge metadata is explicit and labeled; it is not proof
producing. If strict escalation cannot prove a result, the public result is `Unknown`.

Higher crates should carry object facts such as sparse coordinates, ring structure,
plane facts, or retained bounds, but the final topology-changing decision should remain
exact or explicitly unknown.

## Numerical Explosion

`hyperlimit` combats numerical explosion by staging predicate work. Structural facts,
retained bounds, determinant schedules, certified filters, and bounded `Real`
refinement are tried before generic exact expansion. When those stages cannot certify a
sign or relation, the result stays `Unknown` rather than forcing unbounded arithmetic.

## Performance Model

`hyperlimit` is designed to avoid expensive exact work in common cases. It uses
structural zero/sign facts, retained point/segment/triangle/AABB facts, determinant
schedule hints, certified filters, and versioned cache objects before generic
refinement. Optional batch APIs and the `parallel` feature let callers evaluate many
independent predicates through the same strict path.

Dispatch tracing exists to show whether predicates are using structural facts, exact
reducers, filters, bounded refinement, or fallback paths.

## Current Status

Version `0.4.0` is an early but usable predicate crate. It currently includes:

- predicate-facing re-exports of lattice-owned `Point2`, `Point3`, shared-scale point
  facts, homogeneous points, and Pluecker lines;
- `Plane3`, prepared plane facts, homogeneous point/plane incidence classification,
  exact two-plane/three-plane intersection wrappers, and report-bearing
  plane/AABB support-extrema classification;
- exact real and point ordering, squared-distance comparison, interval, AABB, segment,
  ring, triangle, line, plane, orientation, in-circle, in-sphere, and
  D-dimensional orientation/in-sphere/affine-independence predicates;
- exact report-bearing even-odd point/ring classification that retains boundary
  edge checks, y-straddle comparisons, orientation signs, and crossing parity;
- exact report-bearing 3D triangle/triangle classification that composes
  plane-side rejection, segment/triangle edge replay, and coplanar projected
  overlap predicates;
- exact segment/ray triangle reports that retain support-plane crossing
  parameters, candidate points, and point/triangle replay evidence;
- exact support k-DOP slab carriers with witness-preserving point and AABB projection
  classifiers;
- exact 3D halfspace feasibility reports over `Plane3` systems, using active-set
  candidates, point-plane replay, and Farkas-style negative certificates instead
  of primitive LP tolerances;
- immediate segment, triangle, AABB, line, circle/sphere, and halfspace
  classifiers with explicit reusable facts and evidence;
- `PredicateOutcome`, `PredicateReport`, `PredicateCertificate`, certainty,
  precision-stage, and API-semantics types;
- versioned sessions, construction certificates, cached approximate-view labels, and
  optional parallel batch APIs.

Known limits: `hyperlimit` intentionally stops at reusable predicates and small
classifiers. It does not store curves, triangulations, meshes, solver active sets, or
domain-specific geometry.

## Installation

```toml
[dependencies]
hyperlimit = "0.4.0"
```

Feature summary:

- `std`: default support feature.
- `parallel`: enables batch predicate variants backed by Rayon.
- `dispatch-trace`: records predicate dispatch provenance during benchmarks.

## Usage

```rust
use hyperlimit::{
    Plane3, Point2, Point3, Sign, classify_homogeneous_point_plane,
    intersect_three_planes, orient2d,
};
use hyperreal::Real;

let a = Point2::new(Real::from(0), Real::from(0));
let b = Point2::new(Real::from(1), Real::from(0));
let c = Point2::new(Real::from(0), Real::from(1));

assert_eq!(orient2d(&a, &b, &c).value(), Some(Sign::Positive));

let px = Plane3::new(Point3::new(Real::from(1), Real::from(0), Real::from(0)), Real::from(-1));
let py = Plane3::new(Point3::new(Real::from(0), Real::from(1), Real::from(0)), Real::from(-2));
let pz = Plane3::new(Point3::new(Real::from(0), Real::from(0), Real::from(1)), Real::from(-3));
let point = intersect_three_planes(&px, &py, &pz);
assert_eq!(classify_homogeneous_point_plane(&point, &px).value(), Some(true));
```
